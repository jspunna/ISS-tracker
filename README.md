# ISS-tracker

I created a simple, but interesting Python application that tracks the location of the International Space Station, when looking up from Earth.

The application integrates the Open Notify API, which get the current longitude and latitude of the ISS, and displays the location of the ISS(as a red dot) on the world map, a GUI built using Python's Turtle module.

Run the main.py file to run the application.
